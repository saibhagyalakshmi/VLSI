This project implements a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog along with a testbench for verification. 
The ALU supports various arithmetic and logical operations and includes a Zero flag to indicate when the result is zero. 
This Verilog example represents a simplified ALU with the ability to perform several basic operations and set status flags. 
The ALU can support various types of operations, including:
	Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction.
	Logical: AND, OR, XOR, NOR.
	Shift: Logical left shift, logical right shift, arithmetic shift.
	Comparison: Set less than (SLT), equal, not equal, greater than.
	Conditional Operations: Some implementations may support conditional branching depending on the status flags (Zero, Overflow, Negative).
